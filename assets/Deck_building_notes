village impact ok for getting a general idea, but not for deeper considerations

theoretically ideal ratio wolves to villagers 1:4
BUT wolves have advantage when playing w/ new people
As games go on people develope strategies and advantage shifts toward villagers

harder for villagers when everyone's new
harder for wolves when everyone's experienced
